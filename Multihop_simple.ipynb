            "context:  I think it’s important for people to think I look crazy.”) Because he was so successful at this kind of public relations, his fall from grace was another mark against an industry that was already roiled by bankruptcies and scandals.Some additional trouble for the crypto industry is likely to come from one crucial element of the fraud trial — the part where the government must prove intent.The first part of proving the government’s case is pretty simple and a little boring: prosecutors must show that certain transactions took place.Whatever records the Southern District of New York has for the transactions will be shown.“What conversations happened between him and his co-conspirators that are now cooperating against him?” The second part is where all the drama is likely to come, says Christopher LaVigne, a litigation partner and co-chair of the cryptocurrency practice at the law firm Withers.Prosecutors have to connect those transactions to Bankman-Fried, show that he knew what he was doing was wrong, and prove that he lied about it anyway. source: https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/28/23893269/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-trial-evidence-crypto He may suggest he was acting on the advice of his lawyers.But he may also introduce other evidence that could be troublesome — implying, for instance, that he was engaged in standard industry behavior or that everything that happened was Binance’s fault.That may be risky, but we already know that Bankman-Fried loves risk.“Is he going to throw the entire industry under the bus?” Wong asks.“An idea like, ‘Everyone was doing this, it’s not fair I’m the only one who was charged?’” That may not fly in a court of law, but it could absolutely damage public perception of crypto at large.For instance, just before he was arrested, Bankman-Fried brought forward messages from a crypto group chat in testimony he planned to give before Congress.In that testimony, he primarily blames Binance and his lawyers at the firm Sullivan & Cromwell. source: https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/28/23893269/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-trial-evidence-crypto “In the end, Sam started and built two billion-dollar businesses,” he concluded.“He didn’t steal any money.” A Frenchman who lives in London testifies in New York After lawyers from both sides depicted two very different Bankman-Frieds, the prosecution called its first two witnesses to the stand—and they weren’t blockbuster names or former lieutenants-turned-government-cooperators, like Ellison.The first was a victim: Marc-Antoine Julliard, a Paris-born cocoa trader who lives in London.In 2021, Julliard, who had coiffed hair and spoke with a strong French accent, decided to invest in crypto and landed on FTX as his exchange of choice, where he traded cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin.On Nov. 8, in the crypto exchange’s final few days, he tried to pull out his cash and crypto.How much?Almost $100,000, he said. source: https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/10/04/sam-bankman-fried-lawyers-opening-statements-witnesses-marc-antoine-julliard-adam-yedidia-ftx-commodities-trader-developer/ \n",

This panel contains a summary of content drawn from the Knowledge Graph database,” the complaint states.“Google compiled this massive database by extracting information from Publishers’ websites — what Google calls ‘materials shared across the web’ —and from ‘open source and licensed databases,'” it says. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/15/news-publisher-files-class-action-antitrust-suit-against-google-citing-ais-harms-to-their-bottom-line/ The company brings in hundreds of billions of dollars a year, profits that skew Google’s choices and priorities.As Google’s founders wrote back in 1997: “we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.” At the end of the day, it’s Google’s world, and the SEOs are only living in it There’s a reason why most countries around the world have libraries that are public institutions: information that is controlled by a private business will always be subject to that business’s bottom line.In the beginning, the internet was seen as an improvement on the spirit of the public library.Here was an opportunity to transcend the gatekeepers controlling who could publish a book, allowing mankind to fully connect and share knowledge.Instead, we have ended up in a situation arguably worse than before, where nearly all online information runs through a single company, which assumes a veneer of civic utility, of impassive authority, when it is very much not a neutral entity.“There were so many true believers at Google in the early days,” Cutts told me. “As companies get big, it gets harder to get things done. Inevitably, people start to think about profit or quarterly numbers.” He claimed that, at least while he was there, search quality always came before financial goals, but he believes that the public underestimates how Google is shaping what they see, saying, “I deeply, deeply, deeply believe search engines are newspaper-like entities, making editorial decisions.” He speculated that the company didn’t want the public to think too hard about how search works because that awareness “encourages regulators and makes people realize, ‘Oh, there’s a lot of money here.’” There has always been advertising and polemics from cranks, scammers, and liars.But now we see this stuff surfacing alongside truth, and we can’t tell the difference. source: https://www.theverge.com/features/23931789/seo-search-engine-optimization-experts-google-results \n",

And which of us has gotten good customer service?” Another user described their experience in the last 12 months of selling on Amazon as “being up all night at an effing casino but I'm stuck, the drugs are starting to wear off, but I'm trying to break even on the mortgage payment I'm using to play. That's how it is selling on Amazon right now to me.” The seller went on to describe the experience as a “race to the bottom.” “It's long overdue,\" another commenter wrote. \"When they close me down, I'm applying for a job with the FTC.” Still, others commented that the FTC’s complaint is misguided.“Selling on Amazon is a life-changing opportunity and the amount of sellers that throw stones at the platform is astounding,” one user wrote.Seller skepticism Even sellers who may be sympathetic to the idea of regulating Amazon have concerns, specifically that the FTC's highlighted issues aren't necessarily ones that would make the seller and consumer experience better.Scott Needham, who sells on Amazon and runs a product-finder tool for other Amazon sellers, said he was “surprised by some of the points that the FTC selected.” watch now “I have over the years been very critical of Amazon,” Needham told CNBC. source: https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/06/amazon-sellers-sound-off-on-the-ftcs-long-overdue-antitrust-case.html We not only have this verdict here in the United States, it is a worldwide verdict, right?We established a market worldwide, excluding China.So any remedies, we would presume, would be worldwide.We also have the European DMA; we have Epic v.

            "context:  Initially, the content will come from just two partners, the World Wildlife Fund and A-Z animals.In time, the team would like to expand the AI to include other areas of interest to kids, like space, music, video games and sports.In addition, and perhaps most importantly, the generative AI experience is not happening in real time on the device.“We want to go slow and be intentional and be measured with how we’re introducing this new tech, as well as any new tech for kids, which is why we’re not just hooking the experience up to an LLM at runtime and kind of letting kids go at it,” explains Arjun Venkataswamy, senior product manager for Alexa Kids, in an interview with TechCrunch.“The way that we’ve integrated an LLM here is we use it to generate content at scale offline, and then go through a review process that includes both humans, as well as AI, and then take that reviewed content and then put it into our experience,” he says.In other words, kids aren’t using generative AI on the fly when conversing with Alexa, and the content is pre-reviewed and comes from a small dataset of just animal facts and sources.However, because the AI can generate tens of thousands of potential responses, not every answer can be reviewed by a human before being added to the experience. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/25/amazon-brings-conversational-ai-to-kids-with-launch-of-explore-with-alexa/ “We do want to integrate an LLM in runtime in a more protected way than we would integrate it for adults…However, this approach lets us iterate and figure out the right ways to get both safe and delightful content outputted from the LLM for kids,” says Venkataswamy.Amazon is also preparing to launch an AI-powered “Let’s Chat” Alexa experience for adults later this year, he says.In terms of privacy, the company notes it’s not training its LLM on kids’ answers.In addition, the “Explore with Alexa” experience and any future LLM-backed features will continue to follow the same data handling policies of “classic Alexa” (non-AI Alexa).That means the Alexa app will include a list of the questions asked by kids in the household (those with a kids’ profile) and the response Alexa provided.That history can be stored or deleted either manually or automatically, depending on your settings.Alongside the launch of “Explore with Alexa,” the new Echo Pop Kids speakers will also now be available for purchase, starting at $49.99 in the U.S. The Echo Pop Kids will come in two new designs: Marvel’s Avengers and Disney Princess, which feature corresponding character themes. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/25/amazon-brings-conversational-ai-to-kids-with-launch-of-explore-with-alexa/ Unlike more traditional conversations with Alexa, the AI experience works two ways.That is, it’s not just kids asking Alexa a question and receiving a response.“One of the things we think is really cool about this paradigm is kids aren’t just asking Alexa questions and getting the answers — Alexa is now asking kids questions,” says Venkataswamy.That is, Alexa could ask the kids a trivia question like “What’s the fastest animal on Earth?” As any teacher will tell you, by having the kids try to think of the answer first, the answer will stick in their minds better when they hear the response.“Right now it’s, it’s narrow. Alexa is asking kids trivia questions,” Venkataswamy continues.“But we want to continue expanding on that and making it more interactive.” Eventually, Amazon wants to have this generative AI experience integrated at runtime for both kids and adults, but it knows it needs to proceed carefully, especially with the former.“We do want to integrate an LLM in runtime in a more protected way than we would integrate it for adults…However, this approach lets us iterate and figure out the right ways to get both safe and delightful content outputted from the LLM for kids,” says Venkataswamy. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/25/amazon-brings-conversational-ai-to-kids-with-launch-of-explore-with-alexa/ \n",

            "context:  A new class action lawsuit filed this week in the U.S. District Court in D.C. accuses Google and parent company Alphabet of anticompetitive behavior in violation of U.S. antitrust law, the Sherman Act, and others, on behalf of news publishers.The case, filed by Arkansas-based publisher Helena World Chronicle, argues that Google “siphons off” news publishers’ content, their readers and ad revenue through anticompetitive means.It also specifically cites new AI technologies like Google’s Search Generative Experience (SGE) and Bard AI chatbot as worsening the problem.In the complaint, Helena World Chronicle, which owns and publishes two weekly newspapers in Arkansas, argues that Google is “starving the free press” by sharing publishers’ content on Google, losing them “billions of dollars.” In addition to new AI technologies, the suit points to Google’s older question-and-answer technologies, like the “Knowledge Graph” launched in May 2012, as part of the problem.“When a user searches for information on a topic, Google displays a ‘Knowledge Panel’ to the right of the search results. This panel contains a summary of content drawn from the Knowledge Graph database,” the complaint states.“Google compiled this massive database by extracting information from Publishers’ websites — what Google calls ‘materials shared across the web’ —and from ‘open source and licensed databases,'” it says. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/15/news-publisher-files-class-action-antitrust-suit-against-google-citing-ais-harms-to-their-bottom-line/ Google CEO Sundar Pichai testified Monday in the U.S. government’s antitrust trial against the company.The executive defended Google’s business tactics, including its deal with Apple and other partners to make Google the default search engine.The lawsuit stems from a 2020 antitrust claim over Google’s dominance in the online search market.The claim is separate from one filed in January by the Department of Justice, along with eight states including New York, California and Colorado, that aims to “halt Google’s anticompetitive scheme, unwind Google’s monopolistic grip on the market and restore competition to digital advertising.” The government has argued that Google uses its platforms and deals with partners to block out any competition in search or advertising, thus hindering competitors from accessing the data they’d need to improve their products.Google argues that it’s just doing business.Everybody wants Google as the default engine because it’s the best. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/30/5-things-we-learned-so-far-about-the-google-antitrust-case/ Publishers also can’t block SGE because it uses the same web crawler as Google’s general search service, GoogleBot.Plus, it says Google’s Bard AI was trained on a dataset that included “news, magazine and digital publications,” citing both a 2023 report from the News Media Alliance and a Washington Post article about AI training data for reference.(The Post, which worked with researchers at the Allen Institute for AI, had found that News and Media sites were the third largest category of AI training data.) The case points to other concerns, too, like changing AdSense rates and evidence of improper spoliation of evidence on Google’s part, by its destruction of chat messages — an issue raised in the recent Epic Games lawsuit against Google over app store antitrust issues, which Epic won.In addition to damages, the suit is asking for an injunction that would require Google to obtain consent from publishers to use their website data to train its general artificial intelligence products including Google’s own and those of rivals.It also asks Google to allow publishers who opt out of SGE to still show up in Google search results, among other things.The U.S. lawsuit follows an agreement Google reached last month with the Canadian government which would see the search giant paying Canadian media for use of their content.Under the terms of the deal, Google will provide $73.5 million (100 million Canadian dollars) every year to news organizations in the country, with funds distributed based on the news outlets’ headcount. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/15/news-publisher-files-class-action-antitrust-suit-against-google-citing-ais-harms-to-their-bottom-line/ \n",

            "context:  In perhaps the most unexpected tech news of the year, billionaire and AI evangelist Sam Altman has been ejected from his CEO role at OpenAI by the company’s board after an apparent vote of no confidence.Its exact wording in a release issued this afternoon: Altman’s “departure follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities.” What the hell is happening at the most hyped company in the world?!Here are some totally speculative theories that occurred to us and others around the web.1.Did Altman circumvent the board in a major deal?Based on the board’s language and the way these giant tech companies work, this is the prevailing theory floating around right now. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/17/wtf-is-going-on-at-openai-sam-altman-fired/ There’s also the possibility that Altman was making personal investments in a way that the board disagreed with.With OpenAI poised to be a kingmaker in the field, he would certainly be in a position of power.One would think that, as an ideologically driven person already rich beyond belief and at the head of the world’s leading AI company, Altman would have risen beyond having to do this kind of side deal, or at the very least that scrutiny on him and those close to him would prevent them.But one can never be sure.4.Could it be a major security or privacy incident?The idea that the company has experienced a major, perhaps pervasive, security issue is bolstered by the fact that Microsoft reportedly suspended use of ChatGPT internally a few days ago. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/17/wtf-is-going-on-at-openai-sam-altman-fired/ Sam Altman has been fired from OpenAI, Inc., the 501(c)(3) nonprofit that acts as the governing body for OpenAI, the AI startup behind ChatGPT, DALL-E 3, GPT-4 and other highly capable generative AI systems.He’ll both leave the company’s board of directors and step down as CEO.In a post on OpenAI’s official blog, the company writes that Altman’s departure follows a “deliberative review process by the board” that concluded that Altman “wasn’t consistently candid in his communications” with other board members, “hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities.” Tip TechCrunch Do you work at OpenAI and know more about Sam Altman’s departure?Do you work at OpenAI and know more about Sam Altman’s departure?Get in touch with TechCrunch “The board no longer has confidence in [Altman’s] ability to continue leading OpenAI,” the blog post reads.In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Altman wrote that he “loved his time at OpenAI” and will have “more to say about what’s next later.” i loved my time at openai. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/17/sam-altman-is-out-as-openais-ceo/ \n",

            "context:  Rachel Abrams — a sexual assault attorney and partner at law firm Peiffer Wolf Carr Kane Conway & Wise, one of the law firms working on the multidistrict litigation, who filed the petition to consolidate the various actions in federal court — argues the app-based solutions are half-measures that haven’t quelled instances of sexual violence against passengers on the platform.Mandatory in-vehicle cameras in Uber cars is “essential for safety,” she says.Uber told TechCrunch it cannot comment on pending litigation but said it remains committed to the safety of all users on its platform.In-vehicle cameras as a deterrent Abrams cited data from studies of taxis equipped with in-vehicle cameras, which she says has drastically reduced instances of sexual assaults against passengers, as well as assault of passengers against drivers.“These are predatory, opportunistic drivers taking advantage of vulnerable women, so if they’re on film, they likely wouldn’t commit the crime,” Abrams told TechCrunch.Uber didn’t respond to TechCrunch’s request for more information about why it hasn’t mandated the use of cameras in ride-hail vehicles, but as with any surveillance, there are privacy issues.The legality of mandating cameras also varies across local and state laws. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/13/uber-sexual-assault-survivors-call-for-in-car-cameras-tech-upgrades/ That’s all well and good for a year or two, but at some point that strategy changes from a growth hack to an existential liability.Could Altman and the board have had irreconcilable differences on where that point lies?This doesn’t seem so likely.The company has been very deliberately pursuing this very publicly, confidently and on a long-term basis.Altman and the board seem to be in sync on this, at least for the present.3.Do the numbers not add up? source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/17/wtf-is-going-on-at-openai-sam-altman-fired/ Technology lies at the center of this very human story.Uber has attempted to address sexual assaults by drivers — which the lawsuits claim Uber has known about since 2014 — through new safety features in its app, like a 911 button and the ability to share location with a friend.Yet survivors, and their attorneys, say that response has been inadequate, and they’re calling for better technological solutions like in-vehicle surveillance cameras.Aside from the 911 button and location-sharing feature, which were both introduced in 2018, Uber has added other features to the app over the last five years.In 2021, Uber introduced a feature that allows riders and drivers to record audio during a trip.The following year, Uber launched a pilot to provide passengers with live help from an ADT safety agent, as well as PIN verifications to ensure passengers are connected to the correct driver.Rachel Abrams — a sexual assault attorney and partner at law firm Peiffer Wolf Carr Kane Conway & Wise, one of the law firms working on the multidistrict litigation, who filed the petition to consolidate the various actions in federal court — argues the app-based solutions are half-measures that haven’t quelled instances of sexual violence against passengers on the platform. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/13/uber-sexual-assault-survivors-call-for-in-car-cameras-tech-upgrades/ \n",

            "context:  A new class action lawsuit filed this week in the U.S. District Court in D.C. accuses Google and parent company Alphabet of anticompetitive behavior in violation of U.S. antitrust law, the Sherman Act, and others, on behalf of news publishers.The case, filed by Arkansas-based publisher Helena World Chronicle, argues that Google “siphons off” news publishers’ content, their readers and ad revenue through anticompetitive means.It also specifically cites new AI technologies like Google’s Search Generative Experience (SGE) and Bard AI chatbot as worsening the problem.In the complaint, Helena World Chronicle, which owns and publishes two weekly newspapers in Arkansas, argues that Google is “starving the free press” by sharing publishers’ content on Google, losing them “billions of dollars.” In addition to new AI technologies, the suit points to Google’s older question-and-answer technologies, like the “Knowledge Graph” launched in May 2012, as part of the problem.“When a user searches for information on a topic, Google displays a ‘Knowledge Panel’ to the right of the search results. This panel contains a summary of content drawn from the Knowledge Graph database,” the complaint states.“Google compiled this massive database by extracting information from Publishers’ websites — what Google calls ‘materials shared across the web’ —and from ‘open source and licensed databases,'” it says. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/15/news-publisher-files-class-action-antitrust-suit-against-google-citing-ais-harms-to-their-bottom-line/ It may also be banned from making anticompetitive and exclusive deals with smartphone and computer manufacturers and wireless carriers.Google might end up having to turn over all or most of the data it has collected to other search engines so they can improve their products and attract more users.The DOJ has said that Google gets 16 times more data than Bing does everyday.Enforcers want to show that antitrust law remains relevant and that even though Google is basically the God of the internet, it’s still no match for the U.S. law.The Google outcome could also have a ripple effect on other Big Tech cases.The FTC sued Amazon in September for using anticompetitive and unfair strategies to illegally maintain its monopoly power.The DOJ has been investigating Apple for years over the company’s policy for third-party apps on its devices and whether it unfairly favors its own products. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/13/more-from-the-us-v-google-trial-vertical-search-pre-installs-and-the-case-of-firefox-yahoo/ The DOJ has been investigating Apple for years over the company’s policy for third-party apps on its devices and whether it unfairly favors its own products.There’s an ongoing case between the FTC and Facebook, wherein the agency calls on Facebook to sell Instagram and WhatsApp.This isn’t Google’s only antitrust case in trial right now.The search engine giant last week settled a separate antitrust lawsuit with dating site Match Group.On November 6, Google went to trial with Fortnite maker Epic Games.The latter hopes to prove that Google engages in anticompetitive behavior with regard to its Android app store, Google Play, and its commission structure.Now, onto the roundup! source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/13/more-from-the-us-v-google-trial-vertical-search-pre-installs-and-the-case-of-firefox-yahoo/ \n",

            "Answer:  Yes\n",
            "context:  “The OpenAI / Microsoft drama underlines one of the big near-term risks with AI — that this next wave of technology is controlled by the same tiny set of players who have shaped that last era of the internet,” Mark Surman, president and executive director at the Mozilla Foundation, told TechCrunch.“We might have a chance of avoiding this if GPT-X were responsibly open sourced, giving researchers and startups a shot at making this technology safer, more useful and more trustworthy for people everywhere.” Open and shut In an open letter published by Mozilla a few weeks back, Meta’s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun joined some 70 other signatories in calling for more openness in AI development, though that letter has since garnered more than 1,700 signatures.The backdrop stems from Big Tech companies such as OpenAI and Google’s DeepMind calling for more regulation, warning of catastrophic consequences if the AI levers were to meet the wrong hands — in other words, they argued that proprietary AI is safer than open source.LeCun et al. disagree.“Yes, openly available models come with risks and vulnerabilities — AI models can be abused by malicious actors or deployed by ill-equipped developers,” the letter acknowledged.“However, we have seen time and time again that the same holds true for proprietary technologies — and that increasing public access and scrutiny makes technology safer, not more dangerous. The idea that tight and proprietary control of foundational AI models is the only path to protecting us from society-scale harm is naive at best, dangerous at worst.” On a personal level, LeCun has accused the big-name AI players of trying to secure “regulatory capture of the AI industry” by lobbying against open AI R&D.And on a company level, Meta is doing all it can to encourage collaboration and “openness,” recently partnering with Hugging Face to launch a new startup accelerator designed to spur adoption of open source AI models. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/21/how-the-openai-fiasco-could-bolster-meta-and-the-open-ai-movement/ Google, OpenAI and Microsoft, a close OpenAI partner and investor, have been among the chief critics of Meta’s open source AI approach, arguing that it’s potentially dangerous and disinformation-encouraging.(Unsurprisingly, none are members of the AI Alliance despite being longtime members of the Partnership on AI.) Now, those companies have a clear horse in the race and perhaps regulatory capture on the mind… but they’re not wrong entirely.Meta continues to take calculated open sourcing risks (within the bounds of regulators’ tolerances), releasing text-generating models like Llama that bad actors have gone on to abuse but which plenty of developers have built useful apps upon.“The platform that will win will be the open one,” Yann LeCun, Meta’s chief AI scientist, was quoted as saying in an interview with The New York Times — and who’s among the more than 70 influential signers of a letter calling for more openness in AI development.LeCun has a point; according to one estimate, Stability AI’s open source AI-powered image generator, Stable Diffusion, released last August, is now responsible for 80% of all AI-generated imagery.But wait, you might say — what does IBM gain from the AI Alliance?It’s a co-founder with Meta after all. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/05/meta-and-ibm-form-an-ai-alliance-but-to-what-end/ The FTC is reportedly investigating OpenAI The FTC is reportedly in at least the exploratory phase of investigation over whether OpenAI’s flagship ChatGPT conversational AI made “false, misleading, disparaging or harmful” statements about people.TechCrunch Reporter Devin Coldewey reports: This kind of investigation doesn’t just appear out of thin air — the FTC doesn’t look around and say “That looks suspicious.” Generally a lawsuit or formal complaint is brought to their attention and the practices described by it imply that regulations are being ignored.For example, a person may sue a supplement company because the pills made them sick, and the FTC will launch an investigation on the back of that because there’s evidence the company lied about the side effects.OpenAI announced the general availability of GPT-4 Starting July 6, all existing OpenAI developers “with a history of successful payments” can access GPT-4.OpenAI plans to open up access to new developers by the end of July.In the future, OpenAI says that it’ll allow developers to fine-tune GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo, one of the original models powering ChatGPT, with their own data, as has long been possible with several of OpenAI’s other text-generating models.That capability should arrive later this year, according to OpenAI. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/28/chatgpt-everything-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot/ \n",

            "context:  Generative AI certainly has the potential to do that, but it also has its own costs associated with it, whether it’s a higher cost for these features in a SaaS product or the price for hitting a large language model API if you’re building your own software internally.Either way, it’s important for the folks implementing the technology to understand if they are getting a return on their investment.A July Morgan Stanley survey of large company CIOs found that many were proceeding cautiously, with 56% of respondents reporting that generative AI was having an impact on their investment priorities, but only 4% had actually launched significant projects.In fact, most were still in the evaluation or proof of concept phase.This may be a fast moving area, but it fits with what we’re hearing in conversations with CIOs as well.That said, much like the consumerization of IT a decade ago, CIOs are under pressure to deliver the kind of experiences people are seeing when they play with ChatGPT online, says Jon Turow, a partner at Madrona Ventures.“I think it’s undeniable that enterprise employees, who are the internal customers of the CIO or CTO, have all tried ChatGPT and they know what amazing looks like. They know where it’s early, and they know where it’s inspiring, and for lack of a better word, where they see greatness. And so CIOs are under pressure to deliver that level,” Turow told TechCrunch. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/15/when-it-comes-to-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise-cios-are-taking-it-slow/ To hear the hype from vendors, you would think that enterprise buyers are all in when it comes to generative AI.But like any newer technology, large companies tend to move cautiously.Throughout this year, as vendors feverishly announced new generative AI-fueled products, CIOs took note.Some companies have actually been looking to cut back on spending, or at least stay even, not necessarily looking for new ways to spend money.The big exception is when technology enables companies to operate more efficiently, and do more with less.Generative AI certainly has the potential to do that, but it also has its own costs associated with it, whether it’s a higher cost for these features in a SaaS product or the price for hitting a large language model API if you’re building your own software internally. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/15/when-it-comes-to-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise-cios-are-taking-it-slow/ Interestingly, even large tech companies recognize the gaps in their services and have begun investing heavily in startups alongside VCs.These companies apply AI to their internal processes and thus see the value startups bring to LLM deployment and integration.Consider the recent investments from Microsoft, Nvidia, and Salesforce into companies like Inflection AI and Cohere.What can be done to ensure industry-specific startups that tune generative AI models for a specific niche will prove defensible?To ensure industry-specific startups will prove defensible in the rising climate of AI integration, startups must prioritize collecting proprietary data, integrating a sophisticated application layer and assuring output accuracy.We have established a framework to assess the defensibility of application layers of AI companies.First, the application must address a real enterprise pain point prioritized by executives. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/13/6-vcs-explain-how-startups-can-capture-and-defend-marketshare-in-the-ai-era/ \n",

            "context:  In perhaps the most unexpected tech news of the year, billionaire and AI evangelist Sam Altman has been ejected from his CEO role at OpenAI by the company’s board after an apparent vote of no confidence.Its exact wording in a release issued this afternoon: Altman’s “departure follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities.” What the hell is happening at the most hyped company in the world?!Here are some totally speculative theories that occurred to us and others around the web.1.Did Altman circumvent the board in a major deal?Based on the board’s language and the way these giant tech companies work, this is the prevailing theory floating around right now. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/17/wtf-is-going-on-at-openai-sam-altman-fired/ It’s possible that Sam’s zeal for AGI, even absent a secret project or agreement, led to a major rift between him and the board.It’s been obvious to all that Altman took the company in a much more corporate direction from its origins, changing its legal status and aggressively pursuing enterprise and consumer applications.That doesn’t sound a lot like the “mission” the board wants to advance.Then again, this shift didn’t happen today, and it certainly doesn’t seem like a plausible reason for abruptly firing the CEO and a few others on a beautiful fall Friday afternoon.6.What about IP and legal liability?Altman told me at OpenAI’s Dev Day earlier this month that the company doesn’t want to incur any copyright problems by using (as I had asked about) datasets of pirated books. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/17/wtf-is-going-on-at-openai-sam-altman-fired/ There’s also the possibility that Altman was making personal investments in a way that the board disagreed with.With OpenAI poised to be a kingmaker in the field, he would certainly be in a position of power.One would think that, as an ideologically driven person already rich beyond belief and at the head of the world’s leading AI company, Altman would have risen beyond having to do this kind of side deal, or at the very least that scrutiny on him and those close to him would prevent them.But one can never be sure.4.Could it be a major security or privacy incident?The idea that the company has experienced a major, perhaps pervasive, security issue is bolstered by the fact that Microsoft reportedly suspended use of ChatGPT internally a few days ago. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/17/wtf-is-going-on-at-openai-sam-altman-fired/ \n",

Most of them were built directly for merchants, and they’ve all had to retrofit their platforms even to accommodate basic payment processing and reporting functions for software companies,” he told TechCrunch.As such, the startup is capturing volume as software platforms migrate from legacy processors such as Fiserv and FIS.As that happens, it competes against companies like Stripe (and its Connect product) to embed financial services and payments.Nik Milanović of The Fintech Fund posted on X that he believes that one of the biggest stories of the next decade will be about Stripe, “which looks invincible from the outside, losing market share to nimble competitors.” He added: “I think Rainforest is going to be a big part of that story.” Meanwhile, Infinity Ventures’ Jeremy Jonker and former PayPal exec said he’s been in payments for 13 years and has “never before seen anything like Rainforest.” He told me via email that “Joshua’s background as a software platform founder and then as a payments consultant is a big part of the secret sauce.

Slice — which earlier offered credit card–like cards and at peak issued over 400,000 cards in a month, more than any other fintech or bank — said the merger with the Guwahati-headquartered bank will allow the combined entity to better serve their shared mission and reach more consumers who currently lack access to basic banking services.” More here.“CRED grew its operating revenue by a staggering 255% to $168.1 million in the financial year ending March as the fintech startup, which garners an unusually high level of attention, finds rising adoption of its lending and commerce offerings among India’s affluent individuals.

And I think they responded internally to us in a very thoughtful way and expressed some regret for not engaging us,” he said.The Cherokee Nation issued a statement regarding the criticism.“Regrettably, the Mattel company did not work directly with the tribal government’s design and communications team to secure the official Seal or verify it,” the tribe said.Mattel spokesperson Devin Tucker said the company is aware of the problem with the syllabary and is “discussing options”.The company worked with Mankiller’s estate, which is led by her husband, Charlie Soap, and her friend, Kristina Kiehl, on the creation of the doll.Some Cherokee women were also critical of the doll, with claims that Mattel overlooked the problematic details on the doll and the packaging.“Mixed emotions shared by me and many other Cherokee women who have now purchased the product revolve around whether a Wilma Barbie captures her legacy, her physical features and the importance of centering Cherokee women in decision making,” Stacy Leeds, the law school dean at Arizona State University and a former Cherokee Nation Supreme Court justice, told The Associated Press in an email. source: https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/mattel-cherokee-barbie-criticism-b2459522.html Chuck Hoskin Jr, Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, noted to The New York Times that the doll’s basket wasn’t authentically Cherokee.He also specified that the wrong sets of symbols used for the Cherokee language were included in the packaging of the doll.As a result, the symbols on the package read “Chicken Nation” as opposed to Cherokee Nation”.“To someone who doesn’t read Cherokee syllabary, they’re not going to notice it,” he said.“To the Cherokee people for whom Wilma is of such enduring significance and we have such enduring love for her, to see our seal incorrect, it’s very disappointing because it would not have taken much effort or thought to avoid that.” Hoskin specified that he learned about the creation of the doll six months ago, and that Mattel did not work directly with the Cherokee Nation.However, he specified that the company has been understanding of the criticism.“After some of the problems were revealed, we had very good conversations with Mattel.

We understand people rely on these tools and we’re sorry to anyone who felt the impact of these issues,” the post stated.It’s unclear if this “bug” impacted accounts posting content unrelated to Gaza.Instagram users have posted screenshots showing that Stories about Palestine have received significantly fewer views than other Stories posted on the same day, and allege that their view counts went back up when they posted content unrelated to the conflict. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/19/meta-instagram-palestine-israel-shadowban-censorship-moderation-bias/ “I’ve had to post intermittent non-Gaza content in order to ‘release’ my stories to be viewed again.” It isn’t just Stories.The Arab Center for Social Media Advancement (7amleh), which documents cases of Palestinian digital rights violations and works directly with social media companies to appeal violations, told TechCrunch it has received reports of Instagram inconsistently filtering comments containing the Palestinian flag emoji.Users report that Instagram has flagged comments containing the emoji as “potentially offensive,” hiding the comment.Meta initially did not respond to follow-up requests for comment.When asked for comment, Stone pointed TechCrunch to Meta’s updated newsroom post, which did not directly address issues related to comments containing the Palestinian flag.The organization has also received countless reports of Meta flagging and restricting Arabic content, even if it’s posted by news outlets.Jalal Abukhater, 7amleh’s advocacy manager, said that the organization has documented multiple cases of journalists on Instagram reporting the same news in Arabic, Hebrew and English, but only getting flagged for their Arabic content. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/19/meta-instagram-palestine-israel-shadowban-censorship-moderation-bias/ \n",

            "context:  Twitch has had a tense year, in part due to community backlash over policy changes that affect the way creators can monetize their content.Last year, the company announced that it would end the 70/30 subscription revenue split deal that it had offered select streamers in favor of prioritizing ad revenue.In June, Twitch launched the Partner Plus program, a new monetization tier that would grant eligible creators a 70/30 subscription revenue split on the first $100,000 they make per year.The program further strained its relationship with its community, because the requirements to qualify excluded the vast majority of streamers.Streamers need at least 350 monthly paid subscriptions, and gift subs and monthly subs that come with an Amazon Prime account don’t count.In response, Twitch pivoted eligibility to a points-based system, assigning a value to each subscription tier. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/26/twitch-mike-minton-chief-monetization-officer-twitchcon-2023-partner-plus-revenue-split/ Migicovsky told TechCrunch he can’t share anything on that topic beyond what’s already in the blog post.Though Beeper Mini is running again, there is a caveat: phone number registration isn’t yet working.That means users will have to sign in with an Apple ID.The startup says it’s working to address this too.It has also decided to make Beeper Mini free for the time being, given how “chaotic” things have been over the past few days.“As soon as things stabilize (we hope they will), we’ll look at turning on subscriptions again,” the blog post reads.Although Beeper did not have its app reviewed by an independent third-party security firm before launch, it’s challenging Apple to put it to the test. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/11/beeper-mini-is-back-in-operation-after-apples-attempt-to-shut-it-down/ \n",

This panel contains a summary of content drawn from the Knowledge Graph database,” the complaint states.“Google compiled this massive database by extracting information from Publishers’ websites — what Google calls ‘materials shared across the web’ —and from ‘open source and licensed databases,'” it says. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/15/news-publisher-files-class-action-antitrust-suit-against-google-citing-ais-harms-to-their-bottom-line/ \n",

This panel contains a summary of content drawn from the Knowledge Graph database,” the complaint states.“Google compiled this massive database by extracting information from Publishers’ websites — what Google calls ‘materials shared across the web’ —and from ‘open source and licensed databases,'” it says. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/15/news-publisher-files-class-action-antitrust-suit-against-google-citing-ais-harms-to-their-bottom-line/ \n",

            "context:  The FTC is reportedly investigating OpenAI The FTC is reportedly in at least the exploratory phase of investigation over whether OpenAI’s flagship ChatGPT conversational AI made “false, misleading, disparaging or harmful” statements about people.TechCrunch Reporter Devin Coldewey reports: This kind of investigation doesn’t just appear out of thin air — the FTC doesn’t look around and say “That looks suspicious.” Generally a lawsuit or formal complaint is brought to their attention and the practices described by it imply that regulations are being ignored.For example, a person may sue a supplement company because the pills made them sick, and the FTC will launch an investigation on the back of that because there’s evidence the company lied about the side effects.OpenAI announced the general availability of GPT-4 Starting July 6, all existing OpenAI developers “with a history of successful payments” can access GPT-4.OpenAI plans to open up access to new developers by the end of July.In the future, OpenAI says that it’ll allow developers to fine-tune GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo, one of the original models powering ChatGPT, with their own data, as has long been possible with several of OpenAI’s other text-generating models.That capability should arrive later this year, according to OpenAI. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/28/chatgpt-everything-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot/ Google, OpenAI and Microsoft, a close OpenAI partner and investor, have been among the chief critics of Meta’s open source AI approach, arguing that it’s potentially dangerous and disinformation-encouraging.(Unsurprisingly, none are members of the AI Alliance despite being longtime members of the Partnership on AI.) Now, those companies have a clear horse in the race and perhaps regulatory capture on the mind… but they’re not wrong entirely.Meta continues to take calculated open sourcing risks (within the bounds of regulators’ tolerances), releasing text-generating models like Llama that bad actors have gone on to abuse but which plenty of developers have built useful apps upon.“The platform that will win will be the open one,” Yann LeCun, Meta’s chief AI scientist, was quoted as saying in an interview with The New York Times — and who’s among the more than 70 influential signers of a letter calling for more openness in AI development.LeCun has a point; according to one estimate, Stability AI’s open source AI-powered image generator, Stable Diffusion, released last August, is now responsible for 80% of all AI-generated imagery.But wait, you might say — what does IBM gain from the AI Alliance?It’s a co-founder with Meta after all. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/05/meta-and-ibm-form-an-ai-alliance-but-to-what-end/ \n",

            "context:  To hear the hype from vendors, you would think that enterprise buyers are all in when it comes to generative AI.But like any newer technology, large companies tend to move cautiously.Throughout this year, as vendors feverishly announced new generative AI-fueled products, CIOs took note.Some companies have actually been looking to cut back on spending, or at least stay even, not necessarily looking for new ways to spend money.The big exception is when technology enables companies to operate more efficiently, and do more with less.Generative AI certainly has the potential to do that, but it also has its own costs associated with it, whether it’s a higher cost for these features in a SaaS product or the price for hitting a large language model API if you’re building your own software internally. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/15/when-it-comes-to-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise-cios-are-taking-it-slow/ Generative AI certainly has the potential to do that, but it also has its own costs associated with it, whether it’s a higher cost for these features in a SaaS product or the price for hitting a large language model API if you’re building your own software internally.Either way, it’s important for the folks implementing the technology to understand if they are getting a return on their investment.A July Morgan Stanley survey of large company CIOs found that many were proceeding cautiously, with 56% of respondents reporting that generative AI was having an impact on their investment priorities, but only 4% had actually launched significant projects.In fact, most were still in the evaluation or proof of concept phase.This may be a fast moving area, but it fits with what we’re hearing in conversations with CIOs as well.That said, much like the consumerization of IT a decade ago, CIOs are under pressure to deliver the kind of experiences people are seeing when they play with ChatGPT online, says Jon Turow, a partner at Madrona Ventures.“I think it’s undeniable that enterprise employees, who are the internal customers of the CIO or CTO, have all tried ChatGPT and they know what amazing looks like. They know where it’s early, and they know where it’s inspiring, and for lack of a better word, where they see greatness. And so CIOs are under pressure to deliver that level,” Turow told TechCrunch. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/15/when-it-comes-to-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise-cios-are-taking-it-slow/ Based on the board’s language and the way these giant tech companies work, this is the prevailing theory floating around right now.“Not consistently candid” is a very diplomatic way of saying Altman lied.It’s possible that Altman — and potentially OpenAI President Greg Brockman, who stepped down as chairman simultaneously, then resigned — wanted to make a bold move that he knew the board would not like.It’s not uncommon for these deals to be hammered out quietly in smoke- (or vape-) filled rooms and then presented as a fait accompli, but if it was controversial enough and the board found out about these maneuvers, it could be fuel for an ouster.But what kind of deal would be big and dangerous enough for a summary dismissal of the CEO and famous face of the company?The man was onstage two weeks ago; I just talked with him!What could have happened since then? source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/17/wtf-is-going-on-at-openai-sam-altman-fired/ Ninety-four percent of business leaders agree AI will be critical to all businesses’ success over the next five years, and total global spending on AI is expected to reach $154 billion by the end of this year, a 27% increase from 2022.The next three years are also expected to see a compound annual growth rate of 27% — the annual AI spending in 2026 will be over $300 billion.Despite cloud computing remaining critical, AI budgets are now more than double that of cloud computing.Eighty-two percent of business leaders believe the integration of AI solutions will increase their employee performance and job satisfaction, and startups should expect a high level of desire for and experience with AI solutions in their future customers.Finally, we’ve seen consumption, or usage-based priced tech products’ growth slow in recent quarters.Will that fact lead startups building modern AI tools to pursue more traditional SaaS pricing?(The OpenAI pricing schema based on tokens and usage led us to this question.) The trajectory of usage-based pricing has organically aligned with the needs of large language models, given that there is significant variation in prompt/output sizes and resource utilization per user. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/13/6-vcs-explain-how-startups-can-capture-and-defend-marketshare-in-the-ai-era/ \n",

The Code underpins the DSA, because our intention is to transform the Code of Practice into a Code of Conduct that can form part of a co-regulatory framework for addressing risks of disinformation.” A second batch of reports by disinformation Code signatories have been published today, covering the January to June period.At the time of writing only a handful are available for download on the EU’s Disinformation Code Transparency Center — including reports from Google, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok.The EU said these are the most extensive reports produced by signatories to the Code since it was set up back in 2018.The EU’s voluntary anti-disinformation Code has 44 signatories in all — covering not just major social media and search platforms such as the aforementioned giants but entities from across the ad industry and civil society organizations involved in fact-checking.Google On generative AI, Google’s report discusses “recent progress in large-scale AI models” which it suggests has “sparked additional discussion about the social impacts of AI and raised concerns on topics such as misinformation”.The tech giant is an early adopter of generative AI in search — via its Bard chatbot.“Google is committed to developing technology responsibly and has published AI Principles to guide our work, including application areas we will not pursue,” it writes in summary on the topic, adding: “We have also established a governance team to put them into action by conducting ethical reviews of new systems, avoiding bias and incorporating privacy, security and safety. “Google Search has published guidance on AI-generated content, outlining its approach to maintaining a high standard of information quality and the overall helpfulness of content on Search. To help address misinformation, Google has also announced that it will soon be integrating new innovations in watermarking, metadata, and other techniques into its latest generative models. “Google also recently joined other leading AI companies to jointly commit to advancing responsible practices in the development of artificial intelligence which will support efforts by the G7, the OECD, and national governments. Going forward we will continue to report and expand upon Google developed AI tools and are committed to advance bold and responsible AI, to maximise AI’s benefits and minimise its risks.” Over the next six months Google’s report states it has no additional measures planned for YouTube. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/26/generative-ai-disinformation-risks/ A new class action lawsuit filed this week in the U.S. District Court in D.C. accuses Google and parent company Alphabet of anticompetitive behavior in violation of U.S. antitrust law, the Sherman Act, and others, on behalf of news publishers.The case, filed by Arkansas-based publisher Helena World Chronicle, argues that Google “siphons off” news publishers’ content, their readers and ad revenue through anticompetitive means.It also specifically cites new AI technologies like Google’s Search Generative Experience (SGE) and Bard AI chatbot as worsening the problem.In the complaint, Helena World Chronicle, which owns and publishes two weekly newspapers in Arkansas, argues that Google is “starving the free press” by sharing publishers’ content on Google, losing them “billions of dollars.” In addition to new AI technologies, the suit points to Google’s older question-and-answer technologies, like the “Knowledge Graph” launched in May 2012, as part of the problem.“When a user searches for information on a topic, Google displays a ‘Knowledge Panel’ to the right of the search results. This panel contains a summary of content drawn from the Knowledge Graph database,” the complaint states.“Google compiled this massive database by extracting information from Publishers’ websites — what Google calls ‘materials shared across the web’ —and from ‘open source and licensed databases,'” it says. source: https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/15/news-publisher-files-class-action-antitrust-suit-against-google-citing-ais-harms-to-their-bottom-line/ When it comes to health and wellness, for example, quackery is often in the eye of the beholder.Everyone knows someone who has struggled with the limits of Western medicine.So much of the original draw of the internet was the opportunity for outlier voices to be heard alongside established experts and elites.Looking back on all that had changed around what first attracted people to Google, from the introduction of ads to the efforts to keep users within the universe of Google products, this seemed to be the last straw.The second major reason why Google results feel different lately was, of course, SEO — specifically, the obnoxious-kid-refusing-to-behave-in-class kind of SEO.“SEO that goes against Google’s guidelines, it’s not new,” Ray explained.A decade ago, it used to be called “black hat” SEO, in comparison to the search engine-approved “white hat” tactics. source: https://www.theverge.com/features/23931789/seo-search-engine-optimization-experts-google-results \n",

            "context:  The company brings in hundreds of billions of dollars a year, profits that skew Google’s choices and priorities.As Google’s founders wrote back in 1997: “we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.” At the end of the day, it’s Google’s world, and the SEOs are only living in it There’s a reason why most countries around the world have libraries that are public institutions: information that is controlled by a private business will always be subject to that business’s bottom line.In the beginning, the internet was seen as an improvement on the spirit of the public library.Here was an opportunity to transcend the gatekeepers controlling who could publish a book, allowing mankind to fully connect and share knowledge.Instead, we have ended up in a situation arguably worse than before, where nearly all online information runs through a single company, which assumes a veneer of civic utility, of impassive authority, when it is very much not a neutral entity.“There were so many true believers at Google in the early days,” Cutts told me. “As companies get big, it gets harder to get things done. Inevitably, people start to think about profit or quarterly numbers.” He claimed that, at least while he was there, search quality always came before financial goals, but he believes that the public underestimates how Google is shaping what they see, saying, “I deeply, deeply, deeply believe search engines are newspaper-like entities, making editorial decisions.” He speculated that the company didn’t want the public to think too hard about how search works because that awareness “encourages regulators and makes people realize, ‘Oh, there’s a lot of money here.’” There has always been advertising and polemics from cranks, scammers, and liars.But now we see this stuff surfacing alongside truth, and we can’t tell the difference. source: https://www.theverge.com/features/23931789/seo-search-engine-optimization-experts-google-results A new class action lawsuit filed this week in the U.S. District Court in D.C. accuses Google and parent company Alphabet of anticompetitive behavior in violation of U.S. antitrust law, the Sherman Act, and others, on behalf of news publishers.The case, filed by Arkansas-based publisher Helena World Chronicle, argues that Google “siphons off” news publishers’ content, their readers and ad revenue through anticompetitive means.It also specifically cites new AI technologies like Google’s Search Generative Experience (SGE) and Bard AI chatbot as worsening the problem.In the complaint, Helena World Chronicle, which owns and publishes two weekly newspapers in Arkansas, argues that Google is “starving the free press” by sharing publishers’ content on Google, losing them “billions of dollars.” In addition to new AI technologies, the suit points to Google’s older question-and-answer technologies, like the “Knowledge Graph” launched in May 2012, as part of the problem.“When a user searches for information on a topic, Google displays a ‘Knowledge Panel’ to the right of the search results.
